When you buy a life insurance, the insurer offering it will levy a charge for providing insurance protection upon death and to cover certain expenses. In a nutshell, it is the actual cost of insurance, which is deducted by insurer every month from your policy’s account value. It doesn’t make any sense in health insurance.
